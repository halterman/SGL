Instructions

1. Click within the window at three different locations, 
   placing three initial points. These points form the vertices
   of the Sierpinski triangle the program will generate. These 
   three points constitute the vertex points. 

2. Click within the window one more time to place a fourth 
   point called the seed point. 

3. Once you have placed the seed point, the program will generate 
   the next point by computing the midpoint between the seed point 
   and one of the three vertex points selected at random. 

4. The program continues generating new points by computing the 
   midpoint of the most recently created point and a randomly 
   selected vertex point. 

5. After establishing the vertex and seed points, you may reposition 
   them at any time by dragging them with the mouse. 

6. You may direct the program to generate more or fewer points by 
   pressing the cursor keys. As the number of points increase, the 
   image of the Sierpinski triangle becomes more distinct, but the 
   time to render the image increases. 

7. Any mouse motion within the viewing area regenerates all the 
   points by the process described in #3 and #4 above.
